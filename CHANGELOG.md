## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

#### `/ds` — Dataset & member download

- `DOWNLOAD_MEMBER` — Download a PDS member to the local workspace (`downloads/<DATASET>/<MEMBER>.ext`)
- `DOWNLOAD_ALL_MEMBERS` — Download all members of a PDS in a single operation via `Download.allMembers()`
- `DOWNLOAD_ALL_DATASETS` — Download all datasets matching a pattern via `List.dataSet()` + `Download.allDataSets()`
- Contextual "Open file" / "Open folder" buttons after each download
- Local filenames in uppercase, extension derived from PDS qualifiers (`.cbl`, `.jcl`, `.asm`, `.cpy`, `.pli`, `.rexx`…)
- Configurable target directory per request (`targetDir`), defaults to `<workspace>/downloads/`

#### `/ds` — Local → mainframe upload

- `UPLOAD_FILE_TO_MEMBER` — Upload a local file to a PDS member via `Upload.fileToDataset()` (absolute or workspace-relative path)
- `UPLOAD_DIR_TO_PDS` — Upload all files from a local directory to a PDS via `Upload.dirToPds()` (each file becomes a member, name truncated to 8 characters)
- Upload report: source files, size, created members
- Automatic resolution of relative paths from the workspace root

#### Language Model Tools

- `#zos_downloadMember` — Download a PDS member to the local workspace
- `#zos_downloadAllMembers` — Download all members of a PDS
- `#zos_downloadAllDatasets` — Download all datasets matching a pattern
- `#zos_uploadFileToPds` — Upload a local file to a PDS member
- `#zos_uploadDirToPds` — Upload a local directory to a PDS

- `CANCEL_JOB` — Cancel active jobs (with confirmation)
- `PURGE_JOB` — Purge jobs from JES queue (with confirmation)
- `MONITOR_JOB` — Poll job status until completion with auto-diagnostic on error

#### `/run` — JCL Submission
- `SUBMIT_DATASET` — Submit JCL from a dataset or PDS member
- `SUBMIT_INLINE` — Submit JCL provided directly in chat
- `SUBMIT_AND_MONITOR` — Submit + automatic monitoring + spool display on completion
- `RESUBMIT` — Re-submit JCL from a previous job (retrieved from JESJCL spool)

#### Language Model Tools
- `#zos_listDatasets` — List datasets matching a pattern
- `#zos_listMembers` — List PDS members
- `#zos_readMember` — Read a PDS member's content
- `#zos_datasetInfo` — Get dataset attributes (DSORG, RECFM, LRECL, BLKSIZE…)

#### Safety & Security
- Three-tier safety levels: safe / moderate / dangerous
- Automatic production zone detection (`*.PROD.*`, `*.PRD.*`, `SYS*.**` patterns)
- Modal confirmation dialogs for dangerous operations
- Configurable protected dataset patterns via settings

#### Infrastructure
- Zowe session management via Zowe Explorer API or Team Config (`zowe.config.json`)
- esbuild bundling for optimized VSIX packaging
- Local telemetry stored in VS Code `globalState` (no external data transmission)
- Configurable settings: timeout, poll interval, spool truncation, protected patterns
